I am a MD/PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. I work in the lab of Miguel Nicolelis. My broad research interests include systems neuroscience, neuroscience methods and motor control. My disseration focuses on bimanual movements and developing tools for large scale in vivo electrophysiology.

I previously attended Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio for a BSE and MS in Biomedical engineering. For my thesis, I worked under Jayme Knutson in the Functional Electrical Stimulation center.

After graduation, I plan to pursue a post doc in neuroscience.
