     <h3>
       LED Light Source
     </h3>

     <p>
       There are several important features of our light source for whisker imaging: 1) We
       need the light to be sufficiently <b>intense</b> so that short exposure times
       can be used to capture the fast moving whiskers; 2) The light source should be
       <b>collimated</b> to best emphasize the contrast between the whiskers and the background;
       and 3) The light source should be in the near <b>infrared</b> spectrum so that it is
       invisible to the animal. <br>
       <br>
       We first need an infrared light source that can provide sufficient intensity. Near
       infrared (NIR) light emitting diodes (LEDs) are easy to use and cost effective. Remember
       that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">LEDs</a> are nonlinear electronic devices which take a roughly fixed voltage, but
       variable current. The amount of light (and heat) generated by the diode will be proportional
       to the current input. <br>

       <b>Figure #</b>: Example Current-Voltage curve for LEDs. The current and voltages for individual
       LEDs will vary, but the general nonlinear shape of their IV curve will be very similar. Brightness
       will vary in proportion to the current. <br>

       <br>
       <br>
       There are different options for high-power NIR LEDs on the market. The classic ones
       referenced in whisker papers from the Svoboda family tree are from
       <a href="http://www.roithner-laser.com/ld_standard.html">Roithner LaserTechnik</a>
       in Austria. This is a good option for our EU friends. In the USA, there are several
       options available from large electronic suppliers like Digikey or Mouser. I have
       personally used the Osram LZ4 parts in both 850nm and 940nm wavelength with success: <br>
       <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osram-sylvania-inc/LZ4-40R408-0000/4976734">LZ4 850nm</a><br>
       <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osram-sylvania-inc/LZ4-40R708-0000/4976736">LZ4 940nm</a><br>
       <br>
       There are a few features to highlight about these devices: 1) They are actually 4 LEDs
       packaged together, consequently they require approximately ~12 volts to run; 2) they
       come attached to a star pcb board, which can be a little tricky to solder; 3)
       the input current modulates the brightness; and 4) even with low currents, they are
       going to generate a *lot* of heat. Note that these LEDs are rated for ~1 A, so even at
       10% power, they are going to be generating on the order of 1 Watt (IV = 0.1 A * 12 V). <br>
       <br>

       <b>Figure #</b>: Star PCB boards for high power LEDs. The bottom of these boards
       serves as a heat sink, and while they have 6 terminal pads, they generally only have
       2 connections to the anode and cathode of LED. <br>
       <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/124816/what-is-the-purpose-of-star-pcb">https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/124816/what-is-the-purpose-of-star-pcb</a>
       <br>
       <br>
       First, we need to be able to be able to turn the diodes on. It would be handy to have wires
       attached to the star PCB boards they come attached to. Most of these have 6 contact pins,
       but most are duplicates (the others are for cases where there may be different color LEDs
       which can be controlled individually, whereas we have 4 identical LEDs all wired together).
       The ground for these boards are quite large and made to dissipate heat, which can make
       soldering a little tricky. I generally solder with the back of the PCB on a hot plate turned
       to ~50 C to keep the baseline temperature higher, and allow the solder to stick better to the
       contact pads.
       <br>
       <br>
       Next, we want to attach a heat sink to dissipate the heat this LED will generate. Many shapes
       and sizes of heat sinks can be purchased to attach to the LED; however, I have yet to find
       one that is an ideal shape to work with other components we might have in our neurophysiology rigs,
       or parts I will describe later for light collimation. A heatsink is just a block of metal, so
       we can alternatively glue our LED board to something that is the ideal shape.
       <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143547">This paper</a>
       glues the LED board to a Thor Labs
       <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=AD3LLG">part</a>
       that can then readily be integrated into their optical equipment. <br>

       It is worth mentioning how best to power these LEDs. The packages above will require about
       12 volts, and turn on with 50-100 mA, and steadily increase intensity up to a maximum current
       above 1 Amp. <b> You absolute do not need to use 1 Amp, and should only have to operate
       these LEDs at low power.</b> It is also worth pointing out that these devices have very
       low internal resistance, so if they have sufficient voltage to power the diode (~12 Volts),
       they will draw the amount of current they are provided. For this reason, <b>you should not
       plug your LED into a regular ~12 Volt DC power adapter </b>. The LED will pull as much current
       as can be maximally supplied, and probably immediately burn out (break) the LED. Even if it
       doesn't break, you will have maximum intensity, which is unnecessary and probably not good
       for your eyes. We want a power source with <b>adjustable</b> current output at the
       input voltage. Two simple wants to accomplish this would be the following: 1) a fixed
       voltage source with the LED and a <b>variable resistor</b> in series, which will
       change the current drop across the LED. The current would be equal to the input voltage
       minus the voltage drop across the LED (in other words the voltage drop across the
       resistor) divided by the resistance; 2) we could use a current source with adjustable current.
       It is worth noting that not all voltage/current sources are created equal in terms of noise.
       Switch mode power supplies, which is the technology inside most AC/DC wall convertors are
       <b>electrically noise</b> and not well suited for nearby electrophysiology. I like using
       linear benchtop power supplies. These are certainly overkill, but I am of the opinion
       that a lab can't have too many of these around. They are also the least electrically
       noisy and highly dependable. You can buy from many companies. I have used the following: <br>
       <a href="http://www.saelig.com/gpe-x32x/gpe-2323.htm">GW Instek 2-Channel</a><br>
       <br>
       Don't forget that if you are selecting a fancy linear power supply for low-noise
       physiology nearby, you should shield the cable running from the power supply to your
       LED; otherwise this will be a giant antenna!
