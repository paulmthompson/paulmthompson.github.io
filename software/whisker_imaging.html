       There are several important features of our light source for whisker imaging: 1) We
       need the light to be sufficiently <b>intense</b> so that short exposure times
       can be used to capture the fast moving whiskers; 2) The light source should be
       <b>collimated</b> to best emphasize the contrast between the whiskers and the background;
       and 3) The light source should be in the near <b>infrared</b> spectrum so that it is
       invisible to the animal. <br>
       <br>
       We first need an infrared light source that can provide sufficient intensity. Near
       infrared (NIR) light emitting diodes (LEDs) are easy to use and cost effective. Remember
       that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">LEDs</a> are nonlinear electronic devices which take a roughly fixed voltage, but
       variable current. The amount of light (and heat) generated by the diode will be proportional
       to the current input. <br>

       There are different options for high-power NIR LEDs on the market. The classic ones
       referenced in whisker papers from the Svoboda family tree are from
       <a href="http://www.roithner-laser.com/ld_standard.html">Roithner LaserTechnik</a>
       in Austria. This is a good option for our EU friends. In the USA, there are several
       options available from large electronic suppliers like Digikey or Mouser. I have
       personally used the Osram LZ4 parts in both 850nm and 940nm wavelength with success: <br>
       <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osram-sylvania-inc/LZ4-40R408-0000/4976734">LZ4 850nm</a><br>
       <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osram-sylvania-inc/LZ4-40R708-0000/4976736">LZ4 9400nm</a><br>

       There are a few features to highlight about these devices: 1) They are actually 4 LEDs
       packaged together, consequently they require approximately ~12 voltages to run; 2) they
