     <h3>
       LED Light Source
     </h3>

     <p>
       There are several important features of our light source for whisker imaging: 1) We
       need the light to be sufficiently <b>intense</b> so that short exposure times
       can be used to capture the fast moving whiskers; 2) The light source should be
       <b>collimated</b> to best emphasize the contrast between the whiskers and the background;
       and 3) The light source should be in the near <b>infrared</b> spectrum so that it is
       invisible to the animal. <br>
       <br>
       We first need an infrared light source that can provide sufficient intensity. Near
       infrared (NIR) light emitting diodes (LEDs) are easy to use and cost effective. Remember
       that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">LEDs</a> are nonlinear electronic devices which take a roughly fixed voltage, but
       variable current. The amount of light (and heat) generated by the diode will be proportional
       to the current input. <br>

       <b>Figure #</b>: Example Current-Voltage curve for LEDs. The current and voltages for individual
       LEDs will vary, but the general nonlinear shape of their IV curve will be very similar. Brightness
       will vary in proportion to the current. <br>

       <br>
       <br>
       There are different options for high-power NIR LEDs on the market. The classic ones
       referenced in whisker papers from the Svoboda family tree are from
       <a href="http://www.roithner-laser.com/ld_standard.html">Roithner LaserTechnik</a>
       in Austria. This is a good option for our EU friends. In the USA, there are several
       options available from large electronic suppliers like Digikey or Mouser. I have
       personally used the Osram LZ4 parts in both 850nm and 940nm wavelength with success: <br>
       <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osram-sylvania-inc/LZ4-40R408-0000/4976734">LZ4 850nm</a><br>
       <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osram-sylvania-inc/LZ4-40R708-0000/4976736">LZ4 9400nm</a><br>
       <br>
       There are a few features to highlight about these devices: 1) They are actually 4 LEDs
       packaged together, consequently they require approximately ~12 volts to run; 2) they
       come attached to a star pcb board, which can be a little tricky to solder; 3)
       the input current modulates the brightness; and 4) even with low currents, they are
       going to generate a *lot* of heat. Note that theese LEDs are rated for ~1 A, so even at
       10% power, they are going to be generating on the order of 1 Watt (IV = 0.1 A * 12 V). <br>
       <br>
       First, we need to be able to be able to turn the diodes on. It would be handy to have wires
       attached to the star PCB boards they come attached to. Most of these have 6 contact pins,
       but most are duplicates (the others are for cases where there may be different color LEDs
       which can be controlled individually, whereas we have 4 identical LEDs all wired together).
       The ground for these boards are quite large and made to dissipate heat, which can make
       soldering a little tricky. I generally solder with the back of the PCB on a hot plate turned
       to ~50 C to keep the baseline temperature higher, and allow the solder to stick better to the
       contact pads.

       Next, we want to attach a heat sink to dissipate the heat this LED will generate. Many shapes
       and sizes of heat sinks can be purchased to attach to the LED; however, I have yet to find
       one that is an ideal shape to work with other components we might have in our neurophysiology rigs,
       or parts I will describe later for light collimation. A heatsink is just a block of metal, so
       we can alternatively glue our LED board to something that is the ideal shape.

       glues the LED board to a Thor Labs
       <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=AD3LLG">This paper</a>
       for a different purpose that can then readily be integrated into their optical equipment.
