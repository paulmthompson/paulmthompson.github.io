<p><a href="#Kennedy1998">(Kennedy &amp; Bakay, 1998)</a> - ALS patient is implanted with an electrode that she is able to control the activity of.</p>

<h3 id="chapin-1999">Chapin 1999</h3>
<p><a href="#Chapin1999">(Chapin, Moxon, Markowitz, &amp; Nicolelis, 1999)</a> - (Nicolelis Group) Trained <em>rats</em> to get water from a mechanism where a lever controlled a <em>1D robotic arm</em> that could get water. In neuroprosthetic mode, the lever no longer controlled the arm, and the electrical recordings instead moved the arm to get water. 4/6 rats succeeded. More neurons were better than single neurons. Pre lever signal was better than signals during the movement itself.</p>

<h3 id="wessberg-2000">Wessberg 2000</h3>
<p><a href="#Wessberg2000">(Wessberg et al., 2000)</a> - (Nicolelis Group) Trained <em>monkeys</em> in two tasks: 1) 1D movement of a lever and 2) <em>3D robotic arm</em> movements to 1 of 4 locations. Trained on
task 1 and then carried out task 1 and 2. There was another arm in MIT that moved too. Recorded from M1,PMd, and Parietal. </p>

<h3 id="serruya-2002">Serruya 2002</h3>
<p><a href="#Serruya2002">(Serruya, Hatsopoulos, Paninski, Fellows, &amp; Donoghue, 2002)</a> - (Donoghue Group) <em>Monkeys</em> were able to move a <em>2D cursor</em> to a target using only 7-30 neurons.</p>

<h3 id="taylor-2002">Taylor 2002</h3>
<p><a href="#Taylor2002">(Taylor, Tillery, &amp; Schwartz, 2002)</a> - (Schwartz Group) <em>Monkeys</em> moved a <em>3D virtual cursor</em>. compared open loop and closed loop control and found that closed loop control was better, and that closed loop control could improve with time. recorded from ~18 neurons. Created a <em>coadaptive</em> algorithm that would not require training with able bodied monkeys (could start with hands restrained) </p>

<h3 id="talwar-2002">Talwar 2002</h3>
<p><a href="#Talwar2002">(Talwar et al., 2002)</a> - (Chapin Group) Stimulated <em>rats</em> S1 and medial forebrain bundle to signal reward in a maze. The rats were stimulated to “feel” touch of their whiskers on the left or right side to navigate the maze. Rats were removed from the maze to apply the learning in a new environment. MFB stimulate served as a forward cue.</p>

<h3 id="carmena-2003">Carmena 2003</h3>
<p><a href="#Carmena2003">(Carmena et al., 2003)</a> - (Nicolelis Group) <em>monkeys</em> were implanted in dorsal premotor, SMA, M1, S1 medial intraparietal. Three tasks included: reaching, hand gripping, reach + grasp. compared recordings to position, velocity, gripping force and EMG. Monkeys held a pole that moved a 2D cursor and applying force caused the cursor to increase or decrease in size. For task 1, they had to move the cursor into the goal, task two they had to apply the appropriate grip force to expand the cursor into the size of the goal circle, in task three they had to do a combination of these two. A robot arm was eventually incoporated which had 6D of freedom wiht a 1D gripper. At this stage, the cursor position indicated the x and y coordinates of the hand and the size indicated the grip force. This caused a 60-90ms delay, which initially caused the performance to decline. Used a <em>linear model</em>. They found correlations with  hand position, velocity, gripping force and EMG, which had different respecitive correlations with different areas.</p>

<h3 id="musallam-2004">Musallam 2004</h3>
<p><a href="#Musallam2004">(Musallam, Corneil, Greger, Scherberger, &amp; Andersen, 2004)</a> - (Andersen Group) <em>Monkeys</em> were implanted in the <em>medial intraparietal area</em> and performed a <em>3D? cursor</em> task. They found that monkeys performed better when they knew they were getting juice compared to water, and therefore reward type was correlated with better predictive ability of the neurons being recorded.</p>

<h3 id="santhanam-2006">Santhanam 2006</h3>
<p><a href="#Santhanam2006">(Santhanam, Ryu, Yu, Afshar, &amp; Shenoy, 2006)</a> - (Shenoy Group) <em>Monkeys</em> were implanted in the <em>dorsal premotor cortex</em> who then performed a <em>2D cursor</em> task. The monkeys identified the final target location of the cursor and in this way, the BCI was able to work faster because there was less information in the middle to accumulate error.</p>

<h3 id="hochberg-2006">Hochberg 2006</h3>
<p><a href="#Hochberg2006">(Hochberg et al., 2006)</a> - (Donoghue Group) <em>Human</em> with electrode array in <em>M1</em> was able to move a 2D cursor to perform simulated computer functions as well as control a 1D robotic hand and multi-joint arm. linear algothrim. </p>

<h3 id="velliste-2008">Velliste 2008</h3>
<p><a href="#Velliste2008">(Velliste, Perel, Spalding, Whitford, &amp; Schwartz, 2008)</a> - (Schwartz Group) <em>Monkeys</em> use a <em>4D arm</em> with gripper to perform a self-feeding task where they would grab food. Used population vector algorithm with 4 dimensions (3 arm + 1 hand).</p>

<h3 id="moritz-2008">Moritz 2008</h3>
<p><a href="#Moritz2008">(Moritz, Perlmutter, &amp; Fetz, 2008)</a> - (Fetz Group) <em>Monkeys</em> were implanted in the wrist motor area and learned to use neurons to make a <em>2D cursor</em>. The wrist nerve was then blocked and monkeys controlled the cursor without any wrist movement to go along with it. Then, they connected FES to the wrist muscles and make the cursor controlled by wrist torque. Linear and inverse relationship to cell firing were both used. Extensors and
Flexors were then both controlled. Argue for single cell control with many cells to many muscles in the future.</p>

<h3 id="mulliken-2008">Mulliken 2008</h3>
<p><a href="#Mulliken2008">(Mulliken, Musallam, &amp; Andersen, 2008)</a> - (Andersen Group) <em>Monkey</em> was implanted with with two 32 electrode arrays (one in IPS, one in area 5). They performed a <em>2D cursor</em> task with joystick training. Had to fixate on the cursor to keep eye coordinate parietal signals constant. Used a Goal-based Kalman Filter which outperformed regular kalman filter, ridge filter and least squares to reconstructure trajectories from old data. Found that the parietal cortex encoded velocity 10ms in the future and position 40 ms in the future. Also had a ridge filter control cursor in real time.</p>

<h3 id="pohlmeyer-2009">Pohlmeyer 2009</h3>
<p><a href="#Pohlmeyer2009">(Pohlmeyer et al., 2009)</a> - (Miller Group) Proof of concept were <em>monkeys</em>
used <em>FES</em> to control wrist flexor muscles under a nerve block.</p>

<h3 id="simeral-2011">Simeral 2011</h3>
<p><a href="#Simeral2011">(Simeral, Kim, Black, Donoghue, &amp; Hochberg, 2011)</a> - (Donoghue Group) 1000 day followup of patient
from Hochberg 2006. Repeated many of the 2D cursor and click tasks. Also did impedence measurements from all of the electrodes. They found that 72 were still recording spikes. They also did LFP recordings from all of the electrodes to see if they could be useful that that even if they were “broken.” And found that all but 7 were able to record from LFP signals.</p>

<h3 id="odoherty-2011">O’Doherty 2011</h3>
<p><a href="#ODoherty2011">(O’Doherty et al., 2011)</a> - (Nicolelis Group) <em>Monkeys</em> performed a <em>2D avatar</em> task where they had to select the right object as indicated by ICMS feedback. They trained with a joystick and hovered over one of several objects which indicated a reward via microwire ICMS of a particular frequency. Had to multiplex neuron records (to account for ICMS) with clock. </p>

<h3 id="gilja-2012">Gilja 2012</h3>
<p><a href="#Gilja2012">(Gilja et al., 2012)</a> - (Shenoy Group) Used a new filter algorithm, the <em>recalibrated feedback intention trained Kalman filter (ReFIT-KF)</em> to have <em>monkeys</em> move a <em>2D cursor</em>. This was compared to a velocity-KF which has been previously used, and the ReFIT-KF was straighter, faster and easier to stop. Initiated control of cursor with
relationship between neural activity and natural arm movements, instead of gradually backing off assistance. They are assuming that the desired output of the cursor is what they get, not some perfect cursor. Internal model = cursor position IRL</p>

<h3 id="hochberg-2012">Hochberg 2012</h3>
<p><a href="#Hochberg2012">(Hochberg et al., 2012)</a> - (Donoghue Group) Two <em>humans</em> were implanted in M1 (one 5 years prior). They imagined controlling a robotic arm as it went through a pre-programmed routine; also imagined squeezing their hand. One subject used two different robotic arms (in different trials). Trials considered whether subjects could touch the goal and also whether they could grab the goal. Success was about ~40 and ~60 percent for respective participants in grasping. One had a 95% touch rate (insane). Grabbed a bottle of coffee in 2D.</p>

<h3 id="ethier-2012">Ethier 2012</h3>
<p><a href="#Ethier2012">(Ethier, Oby, Bauman, &amp; Miller, 2012)</a> - (Miller Group) <em>Monkeys</em> were implanted in hand area of M1 and implanted with IM electrodes in the forearm. The neural data was correlated to EMG activity. Monkeys were then injected with peripheral nerve block. Monkeys then completed trials were they had to produce a desired level of grasp force as indicated to the monkey by visual feedback from the force sensor. There were trials with
different levels of required force. Argue for many neurons for control of each desired output variable.</p>

<h3 id="collinger-2013">Collinger 2013</h3>
<p><a href="#Collinger2013">(Collinger et al., 2013)</a> - (Schwartz Group) <em>Human</em> was implanted in M1 with two 96 electrode arrays to be able to control a 7D arm (3D translation + 3D orientation + 1D grasping). Used the linear population vector decoder. For training, the limb moved to different spaces with automated visual commands saying what was happening as the subject watched. Next, the participant was able to move the arm with assistance (the arm would only move correctly toward or away from the target with nothing in between). The subject then gradually had assistance backed off. After day 66, there was no impedence. Then did several tasks on the ARAT test. Learning was observed. Clinically improved ARAT score.</p>

<h3 id="ifft-2013">Ifft 2013</h3>
<p><a href="#Ifft2013">(Ifft, Shokur, Li, Lebedev, &amp; Nicolelis, 2013)</a> - (Nicolelis Group) <em>Monkeys</em> performed bimanual control of <em>two 2D avatar arms</em>. The monkeys were implanted with a lot of electrodes in M1, parietal, premotor and S1 (Monkey 2 just had M1 and S1) . They saw two 2D avatar arms and had to move each to a goal location. There were three modes: joystick, brain + arm movements and brain - arm movements. Monkey 1 went through this paradigm, but monkey 2 did not use a joystick but just watched the arms do a pre-programmed routine. More neurons were needed for the same accuracy with two arms compared to one. The same neuron populations contributed to the movement of each arm.</p>
