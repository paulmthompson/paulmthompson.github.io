Bayesian Decision Theory

[[../Noise.html][Noise]] at both sensory and motor causes there to be uncertainty
in state estimation of the world. Uncertainty opens up the motor
system to statistical analysis

[[../BayesianStatistics.html][Bayesian Stats]] + [[../DecisionTheory.html][Decision Theory]] = Bayesian Decision Theory

Key experiment showed that subjects used Bayesian integration to
estimate the position of a cursor \cite{Kording2004}. With increasing
noise of sensory input, subjects relied less on incoming sensory
information and more on prior.

May be important in perception as well

Evidence that Bayesian stats are used when combining sensory
information from more than one source \cite{Ernst2002}
