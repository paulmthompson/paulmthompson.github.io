#+TITLE: Decision Making Models

* Overview

Perceptual decision making [TOPIC] is a really big topic that spans
many cortical areas as well as different experimental paradigms for
each. 

* Themes and Concepts

** Model Type

There are many different models about how perceptual decisions are
made, and there are many papers describing different models as well as
fitting data to different models. 

** Planning vs Decision Making
If the choice of the decision in question involves moving in a
particular way, there has traditionally been a separation between
decision making and movement planning, such that one sequentially
follows the other. More recently, these have been thought to occur in
parallel in a distributed way, such that the possible decision
outcomes are already being planned up until the decision is made.
