     <h1>Software and Hardware Resources</h1>
     <p>
       I make hardware, software, and devices for neuroscience research. I will distribute as much as I am
       able on this website. You can find categories of these items to the left.
       <br>
       <br>
       For extracellular electrophysiology, I have created the
       <a href="https://github.com/paulmthompson/Intan.jl">Intan.jl software package</a> for acquiring data,
       spike sorting, and controlling experiments. I designed this initially to use with Intan hardware, but
       it can be adapted to be used with other control systems.
       <br>
       <br>
       Part of my research studies touch using the whisker system as a model. Consequently, I have had to design
       experiments that can image the whiskers of awake behaving animals, and process the data. I have made software
       to control the acquisition from multiple cameras simultaneously, and compress the videos. I have also
       developed the <a href="https://github.com/paulmthompson/WhiskerTracking.jl">WhiskerTracking.jl toolbox</a>,
       a Julia-based analysis package that uses deep learning to
       track whiskers in high speed videos.
       <br>
       <br>
       Systems neuroscience is highly interdisciplinary, and I often work with peers who have backgrounds in
       cellular and molecular biology. I am interested in frameworks that let us easily use similar computational
       and analysis tools without requiring extensive background in linux or programming. I have set up a cluster using
       Jupyterhub to spawn programs into your web-browser.
       <br>
       <br>
       Finally, one of the biggest bottle-necks in our lab is our confocal microscope. Several groups have
       recently shown how one can get near confocal optical quality with significant speed advantages
       using a single objective light sheet microscope. I have
       limited optics experience, but have tried to put together a single-objective light sheet of my own.
