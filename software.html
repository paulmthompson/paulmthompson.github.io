       I make hardware, software, and devices for neuroscience research. I will distribute as much as I am
       able on this website. You can find categories of these items to the left.

       Most of my experiments involve some type of electrophysiology. I use equpment from 
       <a href="https://intantech.com/index.html">Intan Technologies</a>, who
       have made their equipment open source and easily customizable. Their 32+ channel headstages are 
       great, but I use the digital and analog inputs and outputs from their acquisition boards 
       to control my experiments, even if I am not doing high-channel count electrophysiology. I also use their 
       analog inputs as my analog-to-digital convertor for single channel experiments with a stand-alone amplifier. 
       
       
       For extracellular electrophysiology, I have created the
       <a href="https://github.com/paulmthompson/Intan.jl">Intan.jl software package</a> for acquiring data,
       spike sorting, and controlling experiments. I designed this initially to use with Intan hardware, but
       it can be adapted to be used with other control systems.

       Part of my research studies touch using the whisker system as a model. Consequently, I have had to design
       experiments that can image the whiskers of awake behaving animals, and process the data. I have made software
       to control the acquisition from multiple cameras simultaneously, and compress the videos. I have also
       developed the <a href="https://github.com/paulmthompson/WhiskerTracking.jl">WhiskerTracking.jl toolbox</a>,
       a Julia-based analysis package that uses deep learning to
       track whiskers in high speed videos.
