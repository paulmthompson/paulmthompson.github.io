I am a researcher in the lab of [Fan Wang](http://www.wanglab-neuro.org/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I study sensory and motor circuits involved in touch and pain.

I completed my BSE and MS in Biomedical Engineering with a focus in Electrical Engineering at [Case Western Reserve University](http://case.edu/) in Cleveland, Ohio. I completed my MD/PhD at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in 2021.

My technical research interests include electrophysiology, microscopy, and experimental hardware development.

I strongly support efforts for reproducibility and technique dissemination in science.
